Malaria Risk Detection Project
This project aims to detect malaria risk from cell images using machine learning techniques. It involves processing image data, building a neural network model, and making predictions on new images.

Overview
The project consists of the following main components:

Data Preparation: Resizing images and creating labels for classification.
Model Building: Building a neural network model using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub.
Model Training: Training the model using the prepared data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance on test data.
Prediction: Making predictions on new images using the trained model.
Setup
To run the project, follow these steps:

Install Dependencies: Install the required Python libraries by running:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Data Preparation: Resize the images and create labels by running the provided script:

Copy code
python data_preparation.py
Model Training: Train the neural network model by executing the main script:

css
Copy code
python main.py
Prediction: After training the model, you can make predictions on new images by running:

Copy code
python predict.py
File Structure
The project's file structure is as follows:

data_preparation.py: Script for resizing images and creating labels.
main.py: Main script for model building, training, and evaluation.
predict.py: Script for making predictions on new images.
requirements.txt: File containing required Python libraries and their versions.
README.md: This README file.
Usage
Ensure you have the necessary image data in the specified directories (Parasitized and Uninfected).
Run data_preparation.py to resize images and create labels.
Run main.py to build, train, and evaluate the model.
After training, use predict.py to make predictions on new images.
